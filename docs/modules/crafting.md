# `crafting.lua`

This is the module that controls autocrafting. It however provides no real usage on its own, currently the available modules are `grid.lua` and `furnace.lua`.

## Interface Information

This section is only going to cover the basic interface, if you want to add your own crafting provider look further down.

The basic interface methods are `requestCraft`, `startCraft`, `loadJson`, `listCraftables`, and `cancelCraft`.

The first step to craft something is to call `requestCraft(name, count)`. It will return a table of information about the recipe. An example of this table is as follows

```lua
{
  success: boolean,
  toUse = {name=count, ...},
  toCraft = {name=count, ...},
  missing = {name=count, ...}, -- this is not present if success is true
  jobId: string,
}
```

Then if that is successful, you can call `startCraft(jobId)` to start the craft. Otherwise the craft is automatically cancelled.

## Registering Craft Provider

If you want to add a new crafting provider you'll need to do the following.

### Add a craftType

Use `interface.recipeInterface.addCraftType(type, func)` to create a craftType provider. A craftType provider is a function that takes a CraftingNode to modify, an item name, an item count, and an internal use table.

The CraftingNode passed in will already have the `name`, `taskId`, and `jobId` fields filled. You will need to set the `type` and `count` of the node, and any additional fields required by your node handlers.

### Add a readyHandler

Use `interface.recipeInterface.addReadyHandler(type, func)` to create a readyHandler. A readyHandler is a function that takes a node of the given type in the READY state and ticks it.

### Add a craftingHandler

Use `interface.recipeInterface.addCraftingHandler(type, func)` to create a craftingHandler. A craftingHandler is a function that takes a node of the given type in the CRAFTING state and ticks it.

### Add a craftableList

Use `interface.recipeInterface.addCraftableList(type, list)` to set the list of craftable items of this type. This is saved by reference, so it may be modified later. This should be an array of item name strings.

### Optionally add a jsonTypeHandler

Use `interface.recipeInterface.addJsonTypeHandler(jsonType, func)` to register a json recipe importer, when a JSON file is loaded it will be distributed to the appropriate JsonTypeHandler.

## Crafting System

When a craft is requested `recipeInterface.craft` is called. This starting call has a flag to force the function to craft it.

If the `craft` function is allowed to, it will first check if the item already exists in the storage system (minus the reserved item cache). If it does, it creates a node type `ITEM`, if that wasn't enough it repeats the process of choosing to craft or use an item, if it's a tag this may resolve differently.

`craft` calls each registered craft handler until one returns true. If none return true then there is no recipe for the item, and a special node of type `MISSING` is created. The craft continues like normal, but gets flagged as not successful.

The craft handler will modify the passed in node to change its `type`, `count`, and any additional fields your craft module requires. If the craft requires items you can call `craft` again (passing in the recursion protection table), then you should add the nodes `craft` returns to your node's `children` table.

Once you're done, just return `true` to signal the system that you created a recipe.

A craft node has a type and one of several states, when the crafting system is ticked the corrosponding handler for each node type and state is called.

The node states are as follows

- `WAITING` - This recipe is waiting for its children tasks to be `DONE`
- `READY` - This recipe is ready to be crafted, but may be waiting for a machine to be available.
- `CRAFTING` - This recipe is currently being crafted.
- `DONE` - This node has been crafted and the item is in the system.

The existing node types are

- `ROOT` - Special indicator, this node signals the top of a crafting tree
- `ITEM` - This represents a quantity of items from the storage
- `MISSING` - This represents a quantity of items missing from the craft
- `GRID` - This is provided by `grid`, and represents a grid recipe
